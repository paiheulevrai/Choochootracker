//
// On-target CPU measurement for Plaits Lab engines (probe builds only).
//
// The audio callback gets about 1500 CPU cycles per sample (72 MHz / 48 kHz) to
// cover EVERYTHING -- synthesis, the LPG, the output stage, the UI and the ADCs.
// Overrun it and the callback cannot finish a block in time: the output glitches
// and the starved main loop stops refreshing the LEDs.
//
// A host-side estimate cannot answer whether an engine fits. A development
// machine is not merely faster; its memory system is different in kind. The
// wavetables an engine reads live in FLASH, which on this chip carries wait
// states and has NO data cache, while on a laptop they sit in L1. An engine
// doing dozens of table lookups per sample is therefore far more expensive here
// than any host timing suggests -- which is exactly how a community engine
// measured at 0.6x a stock engine on the host and still starved the module.
//
// So measure the real thing: the Cortex-M4's DWT cycle counter, wrapped around
// the real Voice::Render, inside the real audio interrupt.
//
// READOUT, in two independent channels -- PLAITS_CPU_PROBE_LEDS and
// PLAITS_CPU_PROBE_AUX, either of which can be built without the other.
//
// LEDS. The eight LEDs become a bottom-up bar, one per eighth of budget, with
// the next LED's brightness carrying the fraction (~1% resolution); see
// Ui::UpdateLEDs. It costs nothing but the engine-select display, which a
// one-model probe firmware has no use for anyway -- nothing is patched, no
// output is given up, and the reading is visible while you play. This is the
// channel a contributor measures with.
//
// AUX. The AUX output becomes a square wave whose FREQUENCY carries the
// measurement: 1000 Hz means the engine consumed the entire budget, 600 Hz means
// 60% of it, 1300 Hz means it is over by a third. Frequency rather than a DC
// level so the reading survives any gain, offset or AC coupling between the
// module and whatever measures it -- an audio interface, a tuner, a scope. MAIN
// still carries the engine's audio, so you can listen while you measure.
//
// The AUX channel is the precise one, and the expensive one: it OVERWRITES the
// engine's own AUX output, so a model with a real second output cannot be heard
// as it ships while the tone is on. It is also the only channel that can carry
// per-section reports or a memhunt readout, which is why the bench, validation
// and memhunt firmwares take it. It is off unless a build asks for it.
//
// This header compiles to NOTHING unless PLAITS_CPU_PROBE is set, so shipping
// builds are byte-identical (asserted by the SDK's build tests).
