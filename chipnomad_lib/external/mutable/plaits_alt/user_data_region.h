// The flash one FM bank occupies, which an audio transfer erases and reprograms
// in place.
//
// In a Plaits Palette build a bank's BAKED array IS its region: the generator
// emits every bank 2 KB page-aligned and padded to a whole UserData::SIZE, so a
// region always covers whole flash pages and nothing else ever shares them.
// That is a correctness requirement, not tidiness — UserData::Save erases those
// pages, so a region overlapping code or rodata would destroy the firmware on
// the first transfer. check_user_data_regions.py asserts it against the linked
// ELF, and the build fails if it does not hold.
//
// Two consequences are worth stating, because they delete work rather than add
// it. An un-transferred slot needs no empty state at all — it simply reads its
// baked bank, exactly as a non-swappable slot does. And a firmware update
// restores every bank uniformly, because the banks travel inside the image.
//
// Regions are keyed on BANK, not slot: two placed slots may map to one factory
// bank (kEngineUserDataBank) and share its flash, and both must see a transfer
// made through either.
