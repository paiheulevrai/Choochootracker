// Braids' BLOW model: a blown-bore waveguide driven by a nonlinear reed and a
// noisy breath pressure.
//
// The algorithm is Emilie Gillet's DigitalOscillator::RenderBlown
// (braids/digital_oscillator.cc:1303-1362).
//
// WHAT THE MODEL ACTUALLY IS. One delay line, one reflection, one reed. The
// bore is a single int16 line read at a fractional delay (1338-1342) and
// closed by an INVERTING reflection of -3891/4096 = -0.94995 (1299, 1347), so
// it behaves as a stopped pipe and voices odd harmonics. The excitation is a
// static breath pressure of 26214/32768 = 0.8 (1298) multiplied by white noise
// (1334-1336), and the reed is a two-segment characteristic -- a line of slope
// -1229/4096 = -0.30005 (1300) about an offset of 22938/32768 = 0.69995
// (1301), hard-clipped (1349-1350) -- whose output multiplies the pressure
// difference (1351).
//
// THE TABLES, checked rather than inherited. The brief for this port said to
// read RenderBlown's "own tables (blowing_envelope, blowing_jet)". It has
// neither. RenderBlown reads exactly ONE table, lut_flute_body_filter (1330);
// lut_blowing_envelope and lut_blowing_jet belong to RenderFluted (1419, 1445),
// the model next door. BLOWN has no excitation envelope at all -- its breath
// pressure is a constant, which is why the model sustains indefinitely and why
// a trigger only flushes the bore (1311-1314).
//
// lut_flute_body_filter reproduces at 0 LSB across all 128 entries from its
// generator in braids/resources/lookup_tables.py:171,
//
//     floor(4096 * min(0.7, 0.4 * 2^((n - 69) / 12)))
//
// and it is the FLOOR that reproduces: rounding instead misses by 1 LSB. The
// truncation is proportionally largest where the stored value is smallest --
// -1.46% at n = 0 and n = 12, against -0.02% at n = 48 -- so the port reads
// the truncated integers rather than the closed form (the phase-2 guide's
// section 4, and the particle-burst finding from wave A). Entries 79..127 are
// all 2867, the
// min(0.7, ...) ceiling, so only the first 80 are stored here.
//
// THE OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ NEXT DOOR: BLOWN IS ON THE SAFE SIDE. RenderFluted
// indexes the same 128-entry table with a raw `lut_flute_body_filter[pitch_ >>
// 7]` (1404), and Render() clamps pitch_ only to kHighestNote = 140 * 128
// (digital_oscillator.cc:44, 120-124), so notes above MIDI 127 read past the
// end. RenderBlown computes the same index but CLAMPS it to 0..127 first
// (1325-1329). Confirmed by reading both: BLOWN never reads out of bounds.
//
// THE BRAIDS CONTROLS, with lines.
//
//   TIMBRE is parameter_[0], line 1322: `parameter = 28000 - (parameter_[0] >>
//   1)`, which is the DEPTH of the breath noise at 1334. It runs BACKWARDS --
//   TIMBRE up means less turbulence -- and it is the model's loudness control
//   as much as its timbre control, because turbulence disrupts the standing
//   wave. Measured at MIDI 45, COLOR 0.5: TIMBRE 0.0 renders at -31.1 dBFS AC
//   RMS and TIMBRE 1.0 at -6.3 dBFS, a 24.8 dB swing.
//
//   COLOR is parameter_[1], line 1324: the whole sum is shifted right by 7,
//   so COLOR's contribution is `parameter_[1] >> 8` -- it moves the index into
//   the body filter by up to +127 semitones, one step per 256 counts of
//   parameter_[1]. RenderBlown uses no INTERPOLATE_PARAMETER macro, so the
//   fold trap in the phase-2 guide's section 1 cannot arise here, but the
//   indices still have to be read the right way round.
//
// A MEASURED PROPERTY OF COLOR WORTH KNOWING. Because the index is
// `(pitch_ - 8192 + (COLOR >> 1)) >> 7` clamped to 0..127, and because the
// table saturates at entry 79, COLOR's useful travel depends on the note and
// is never the whole knob. At MIDI 45 the index leaves 0 at COLOR = 0.1563
// (the raw sum crosses zero at 0.1484, but the `>> 7` keeps the index at 0
// until the sum reaches 128) and reaches the 2867 ceiling at COLOR = 0.766;
// outside that the knob does nothing. Verified by rendering the module: COLOR
// 0.0, 0.10, 0.14, 0.15 and 0.156 come out bit-identical to each other, 0.157
// differs, and 0.766, 0.78, 0.80 and 1.0 are bit-identical while 0.75 differs.
// The port reproduces this rather than
// spreading the knob out, because spreading it would stop being the same
// instrument.
//
//   HARMONICS  Body    Braids' COLOR: the body filter's corner.
//   TIMBRE     Focus   Braids' TIMBRE: turbulent and quiet through to steady
//                      and loud. Backwards on purpose -- it is Braids' axis.
//   MORPH      Blow    the static breath pressure, welded at 0.8 in Braids.
//   MACRO      Reed    the reed's rest offset, welded at 0.69995 in Braids.
//
// WHY THOSE TWO. Both are constants in Braids that the module cannot reach,
// and neither is a knob on the Plaits neighbour: reed-pipe puts breath
// pressure on TIMBRE but welds its rest opening (kReedPipeRestOpening = 0.40),
// and spends MORPH on reed stiffness and MACRO on the reflection coefficient
// and its brightness. Blown's TIMBRE is spent on turbulence instead, so
// pressure is unreachable from inside the model, and the reed offset is
// unreachable from either engine.
//
// RATE (SPEC R5). RenderBlown's loop is `while (size--)` at
// digital_oscillator.cc:1331 with no `size -= 2` -- compare RenderBowed, which
// has one at 1285 -- so it is a 96 kHz algorithm, and it has no internal
// oversampling: one waveguide step per 96 kHz sample. The port therefore runs
// 2x from 48 kHz to reach the same 96 kHz internal rate, and every rate
// constant transfers verbatim: the bore delay (1316), the half-sample
// averaging filter inside the loop (1344-1345), and the body-filter one-pole
// (1355-1356). Running the waveguide at 48 kHz instead would have needed all
// three re-derived, and the in-loop averager is the one that cannot be fixed
// by a gain -- its zero sits at the internal Nyquist, so at 48 kHz it would
// damp the upper harmonics twice as hard inside the feedback path.
//
// The pitch is checked against that: Braids' bore delay is `(delay_ >> 1) -
// (1 << 16)` = period/2 - 1 sample at 96 kHz, and the in-loop averager adds
// half a sample, so the round trip is period - 1 and the model plays slightly
// sharp of the note. At MIDI 45 that predicts 110.13 Hz against a nominal
// 110.00, and the reference renders 110.129 Hz. The port keeps the same
// `1 / frequency - 1` so it inherits the same sharpening rather than
// correcting it.
//
// HOW THE PORT MEASURES AGAINST THE MODULE, and why the A/B is mostly
// triggered. BLOWN is a noise-driven chaotic self-oscillator: which limit
// cycle it settles into depends on the noise realisation, and a HELD render is
// not reproducible even against itself. Twenty renders of the MODULE at MIDI
// 45 differing only in RNG seed span 2.59 dB of AC RMS and up to 8.49 dB of
// pairwise spectral difference at COLOR noon, and 10.49 dB / 9.86 dB at COLOR
// 0. Longer renders make it worse, because the model wanders rather than
// averaging. Retriggering collapses it -- a strike flushes the bore, so both
// sides then average over many independent settlings -- and the same
// twenty-seed measurement at triggerHz 8 gives at most 1.18 dB and 0.69 dB.
// Against that, and across four different RNG seeds for the PORT, its
// triggered cases read -0.49 to +0.43 dB of AC RMS, 0.14 to 1.21 dB of
// spectrum, and -0.3 to +0.2 cents on the cases where a cents tolerance is
// meaningful at all. tests/ab.json carries the numbers and the reasoning,
// including the two cases where ab_engine's f0 estimator fails on the MODULE
// and the tolerance is therefore omitted rather than widened.
//
// OUT: the bore read through the body filter, which is what Braids emits.
// AUX (mono): the raw bore pressure before the body filter -- the same
// waveguide, undressed. Measured at MIDI 45 it sits level with OUT at the top
// of COLOR and 6.75 dB above it at the bottom, where the filter is doing most
// of its work. In stereo OUT/AUX become L/R and the right channel is a second
// pickup 0.62 of the way down the bore, so the two sides are the same standing
// wave heard at two points: measured over 1 s of steady tone the two channels
// correlate at +0.009, against +0.88 for the mono out/aux pair, at equal
// level.
//
// Declared deviations from Braids:
//   - the bore line and the loop arithmetic are float, so the port does not
//     reproduce Braids' int16 quantisation of the delay line, of Mix()'s
//     interpolated read, or of the `>> 1` floors in the averaging filter. This
//     is a declared deviation rather than an oversight, and it was measured
//     before it was declared: a float transcription of the loop, Braids' own
//     loop, and the float transcription with the int16 store and every one of
//     Braids' floors reinstated were run off the SAME noise sequence at the
//     same bore delay. The three float variants agreed with each other to
//     0.1 dB on every odd harmonic, and all three tracked Braids to within
//     1.7 dB on its four strongest and 5 dB on its weakest -- so the
//     quantisation is not what shapes this model's harmonic envelope. The
//     noise realisation is; see the paragraph above.
//   - the 96 -> 48 kHz decimator is a 31-tap Kaiser halfband. Braids has no
//     decimator at all (it drives its DAC at 96 kHz); the reference renderer
//     uses a 127-tap Blackman-Harris halfband. Measured against that reference
//     filter on the worst case for it -- maximum breath noise, maximum
//     brightness, where 3.0% of the native energy sits between 24 and 33 kHz
//     -- the 31-tap costs 0.11 dB of spectral difference and 0.03 dB of AC
//     RMS, all of it in the top octave band.
//   - a one-pole DC blocker on both outputs. The model's static breath
//     pressure leaves a real DC offset in the bore (predicted 0.023 from the
//     loop's fixed point, measured 0.015 to 0.018 on the reference), which
//     Braids emits and a Plaits engine must not.
