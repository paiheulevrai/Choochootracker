// Braids Renaissance's four classical STACK_* models merged into one slot,
// with WTx6 exposed separately as WavetableScaleStackEngine.
//
// Upstream is DigitalOscillator::RenderStack in Tom Burns' Braids Renaissance
// (boourns/eurorack-renaissance): five oscillators starting at the played note
// and spaced an equal number of SCALE DEGREES apart, so one knob sweeps from a
// unison cluster out through stacked seconds, thirds, fourths and beyond --
// and every rung stays in the scale, which is what makes the sweep musical
// rather than an interval ramp. As with `diatonic-chord`, the four classical
// display models differ only in waveform and fold onto MORPH. WTx6 is separate
// so MORPH can scan the table without taking over TIMBRE's spread control.
//
// WHAT SEPARATES THIS FROM `swarm` AND `triple`. Those detune in cents around
// a note; this quantises every voice onto a scale, so wide spans are chords
// rather than clusters and the whole stack transposes diatonically under the
// keyboard. At span 1 in a whole-tone scale it is an interval stack no cent
// detune reaches; at span 2 in a major scale it is a thirteenth chord.
//
// ⚠️ AS IN `diatonic-chord`, upstream's offsets are read as ABSOLUTE. RenderStack
// pre-accumulates its own spans (`acc += span; offsets[i] = acc`) into span,
// 2*span, 3*span, 4*span -- and then renderChord accumulates them AGAIN, which
// is what actually reaches the DAC: span, 3*span, 6*span, 10*span. At the top
// of the knob that puts the fourth voice 160 scale degrees up, far past the
// audible range, so the model quietly loses voices as the knob rises. The
// pre-accumulation is unambiguous about what was intended, and this port does
// the intended thing. Voices that still land out of range at wide spans are
// muted rather than aliased, and the mix does not compensate -- a stack that
// runs off the top of the range is supposed to thin out.
