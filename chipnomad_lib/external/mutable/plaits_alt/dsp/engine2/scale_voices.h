// Shared scale-degree machinery for the two Braids Renaissance ports,
// `diatonic-chord` and `scale-stack`.
//
// Upstream is Tom Burns' Braids Renaissance (boourns/eurorack-renaissance),
// whose CHORD_* and STACK_* models both funnel into one
// DigitalOscillator::renderChord: voice 0 plays the root, and every other voice
// is placed at a SCALE DEGREE above it, resolved through Braids' built-in
// quantizer codebook. That is the whole idea, and it is what separates these
// from Plaits' own `chords` engine -- the chord's quality is not stored
// anywhere, it falls out of where the played note lands in the scale, so one
// knob position gives Cmaj7 on the tonic and Am7 on the sixth.
//
// Plaits has no quantizer and no scale setting, so the scale bank is compiled
// into the engine and MACRO selects its entries. Hosted builds can supply one
// to sixteen scales; ordinary builds retain the original eight. In a
// pentatonic, whole-tone, or microtonal scale a "third" is not a 12-TET third,
// and the chord shapes bend accordingly.
//
// SCALE PITCHES USE BRAIDS' 1/128-SEMITONE UNITS. Keeping the source precision
// is what makes the raga-derived scales genuinely microtonal; an int8 semitone
// table silently rounds away the feature this prototype is meant to audition.
//
// THE ROOT IS C. Braids resolved the scale against the quantizer's own root;
// here degree 0 is the nearest scale tone at or below the played note measured
// from C, which is the same convention Braids shipped with by default.
//
// FINE PITCH SURVIVES QUANTISATION. Braids kept `fm = pitch_ -
// codebook_[index]` and added it back to every voice, so bends and FM moved the
// whole chord rather than being swallowed by the quantizer. The residual here
// does the same job.
