// Braids' CSAW: a sawtooth with a notch cut into the start of every cycle.
//
// The algorithm is Emilie Gillet's AnalogOscillator::RenderCSaw plus the
// DC-shift and make-up stage MacroOscillator::RenderCSaw wraps around it. The
// emblematic Braids waveform, and the one model the module is most recognised
// for.
//
// Two controls Braids does not have:
//   MORPH bends the sawtooth segment, concave through straight to convex.
//   MACRO tilts the notch plateau. At +1 the value step at the notch edge
//   CANCELS, leaving a pure slope discontinuity; at -1 it doubles.
//
// Because MACRO can cancel the value step, a value-BLEP alone would leave the
// engine aliasing worst exactly where the new control is most interesting, so
// the slope discontinuities carry integrated BLEP as well.
//
// OUT: the notched saw.
//
// AUX (mono): a variable-width PULSE -- -1 across the notch plateau, +1 across
// the saw segment -- BLEP'd off the same two transitions OUT already computes,
// with its duty-dependent mean removed at sample rate. A saw against a PWM
// square is the oldest dual-VCO pairing there is, and TIMBRE sweeps the duty
// for free because the plateau width IS the pulse width. Being piecewise
// constant it needs value BLEP only, so it is cheaper than the waveform it
// replaced.
//
// In stereo OUT/AUX become L/R and AUX reverts to the same waveform with the
// notch depth taken from the MIRRORED harmonics position -- a deep notch on
// one side pairing with a shallow one on the other -- PLUS a constant bend
// offset on its saw segment. The bend offset is not decoration: the depth
// mirror is its own fixed point at the knob centre, where the two channels
// were bit-identical and the image collapsed to mono, and no depth remapping
// can remove that. See kCSawStereoBend for why the second axis is required and
// why a constant offset removes the collapse everywhere rather than moving it.
//
// Declared deviations from Braids:
//   - the stereo channel MIRRORS the notch depth rather than negating it.
//     Negating puts the plateau at -0.375 and the output at 1.42 before the
//     registered gain, which clips under a positive gain and breaks the
//     matched-gain L/R pair. Mirroring keeps it inside OUT's own bounds.
//   - Braids' analog oscillator has no bend or tilt, so only the MORPH and
//     MACRO detents reproduce it.

// its own fixed point at the knob centre -- `target_depth == target_depth_aux`
// there, and so does the DC term that travels with it, so the two channels
// were bit-identical at HARMONICS noon and the image narrowed to mono.
//
// No remapping of the depth alone can fix that. A continuous f mapping the
// depth range into itself with f(x) != x everywhere would need f(x) > x for
// all x (impossible: f(max) > max) or f(x) < x for all x (impossible at the
// minimum) -- so a fixed point is guaranteed, and any "better" mirror only
// MOVES the collapse rather than removing it.
//
// So the channels are separated on a second axis instead. BendSegment is
// AFFINE in bend -- BendSegment(u, a) - BendSegment(u, b) = (a - b)(u^2 - u) --
// so a constant, non-zero bend difference makes the two saw segments differ at
// every interior point of the segment, at every knob position, with no fixed
// point anywhere. The segment always exists (pw tops out at 0.375), so the two
// channels can never coincide.
//
// The offset deliberately carries the aux bend OUTSIDE the [-1, 1] the knob
// reaches: clamping it back would reintroduce a fixed point at the extreme.
// At the top of MORPH the aux bend hits 1.35, where the segment dips 2.3%
// below its start before rising -- a continuous wiggle, not a new
// discontinuity, and the integrated BLEP stays exact because
// BendSegmentSlope is the true derivative at any bend. OUT is untouched.
