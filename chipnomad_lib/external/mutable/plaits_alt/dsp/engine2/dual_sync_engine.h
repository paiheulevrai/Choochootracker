// Braids' SQUARE_SYNC and SAW_SYNC: a master oscillator at the played pitch
// hard-syncing a slave that sits a swept interval above it, with a crossfade
// between the two.
//
// The algorithm is Emilie Gillet's MacroOscillator::RenderDualSync driving two
// AnalogOscillator instances through RenderSquare / RenderSaw. The two Braids
// models differ ONLY in the shape handed to both oscillators
// (macro_oscillator.cc:261-262), so one engine covers both and MORPH selects
// between them.
//
// WHICH BRAIDS PARAMETER DOES WHAT, with lines (braids/macro_oscillator.cc):
//
//   :261-262  base_shape = SQUARE_SYNC ? OSC_SHAPE_SQUARE : OSC_SHAPE_SAW.
//             Not a parameter -- the model identity. Both oscillators get it.
//   :263,267  set_parameter(0) on BOTH. For a square that is
//             pw = (32768 - 0) << 16, i.e. exactly 0.5; for a saw the
//             parameter is unused. So neither Braids model has a pulse-width
//             control at all.
//   :265      master pitch = pitch_, the played note.
//   :269      slave pitch = pitch_ + (parameter_[0] >> 2).
//             parameter_[0] is TIMBRE. 0..32767 >> 2 = 0..8191, and Braids'
//             pitch unit is 1/128 semitone, so TIMBRE sweeps the sync interval
//             from 0 to 8191/128 = 63.99 semitones above the master.
//   :271      master Render() fills `buffer` AND emits sync_out.
//   :272      slave Render() takes that sync signal, fills temp_buffer_.
//   :274-279  BEGIN_INTERPOLATE_PARAMETER_1 / balance = parameter_1 << 1.
//             The suffix is the parameter INDEX: this interpolates
//             previous_parameter_[1] -> parameter_[1], which is COLOR, NOT
//             TIMBRE. Reading it the other way is the mistake that shipped in
//             fold's first version; here it would have put the interval sweep
//             and the master/slave balance on one knob and left COLOR dead.
//   :281      *buffer = (Mix(master, slave, balance) >> 2) * 3.
//             stmlib Mix(a, b, bal) = a + (b - a) * bal/65536, so COLOR 0 is
//             the master alone and COLOR 1 the slave alone; the >> 2) * 3 is a
//             flat 0.75 gain, which this port reproduces as kDualSyncOutputGain.
//
//   HARMONICS  Balance    Braids' COLOR: master through to synced slave.
//   TIMBRE     Interval   Braids' TIMBRE: the slave's pitch above the master,
//                         0 to 63.99 semitones.
//   MORPH      Shape      square (0.0) through to saw (1.0). At 0.0 this is
//                         SQUARE_SYNC and at 1.0 SAW_SYNC; the module has no
//                         path between them, since they are two menu entries.
//   MACRO      Reset      the phase the slave restarts at on each sync pulse.
//                         Braids always restarts it at zero (analog_oscillator
//                         .cc:262-264 and :325-327 both set phase_ =
//                         reset_time * increment); noon here is that exactly.
//
// LINEAGE. Plaits' virtual analog engine, VA_VARIANT 2 (virtual_analog_engine
// .cc:210-309), has a sync square: :250-252 derives square_sync_ratio from
// TIMBRE and :271-272 renders it. The differences are not cosmetic. There the
// ratio is (timbre - 0.5)^2 * 4 * 48, so it is flat zero across the whole lower
// half of the knob and reaches only 48 semitones at the top; the same knob also
// sets the square's pulse width (:247-248) and its gain (:254); the saw partner
// (:273) is NOT synced; and nothing crossfades master against slave -- MACRO
// there balances square against variable-saw.
// Dual Sync gives the interval its own knob over the full 64 semitones,
// holds the pulse width at the module's fixed 0.5, syncs the saw as well as
// the square, and puts the master/slave balance on a knob. The swept-interval
// sync-with-balance gesture is not reachable in the neighbour.
//
// RATE (SPEC R5). RenderSquare (analog_oscillator.cc:188-272) and RenderSaw
// (:274-335) each write ONE output sample per loop iteration from ONE
// `phase_ += phase_increment` (:227 and :306) and do NOT end in `size -= 2`.
// Neither has an internal oversampling step. They are therefore 96 kHz
// algorithms running at Braids' native rate, with no internal oversampling on
// top -- unlike the folders behind FOLD, which run 2x on top of 96 kHz.
//
// The phase-increment relation is rate-agnostic, so the pitch mapping needs no
// re-derivation. The BLEP residual is NOT rate-agnostic: at 96 kHz the residue
// of a 2-sample polyBLEP lands mostly above 24 kHz, where the reference
// renderer's decimator removes it, and at 48 kHz the same residue would fold
// straight back into the audible band. So this port runs 2x from 48 kHz to
// reach the same 96 kHz internal rate the module works at, and decimates.
//
// ANTI-ALIASING, measured, not asserted (SPEC R7). polyBLEP (stmlib
// ThisBlepSample / NextBlepSample, the same 0.5*t^2 pair Braids builds by hand
// at analog_oscillator.h:124-136) corrects five discontinuities: the master's
// wrap and its pulse edge, the slave's wrap and its pulse edge, and -- the one
// that carries this model -- the slave's sync reset, whose step is the naive
// value the slave had reached when the pulse arrived, taken to wherever Reset
// puts the restart.
//
// The residual is stated as non-harmonic energy against total energy, measured
// on 3 s renders with a 16384-point Blackman-Harris FFT (-92 dB sidelobes, so
// window leakage cannot be mistaken for aliasing) excluding +/-6 bins around
// every harmonic of the played pitch:
//
//                                          port 2x   Braids ref   port at 1x
//   note 45, Interval 0.5, Balance 0.5, sq  -46.4 dB   -46.7 dB     -38.1 dB
//   note 45, Interval 1.0, Balance 1.0, sq  -47.0 dB   -47.1 dB     -31.3 dB
//   note 45, Interval 1.0, Balance 1.0, saw -46.7 dB   -46.9 dB     -25.6 dB
//
// So the port sits within 0.3 dB of the module everywhere measured, which is
// the point of matching its internal rate rather than picking a rate. The
// third column is this same engine built with kDualSyncOversampling = 1 and
// the decimator bypassed: running the sync at the output rate costs 8.4 dB at
// the stock centre and 21.1 dB at the corner where the slave is highest and
// the balance is entirely on it. That is the measurement the 2x stage is
// bought with.
//
// The decimator is a 47-tap Kaiser (beta 12) halfband -- 12 multiplies plus
// the centre tap per output sample, since a halfband's even taps are zero.
// Response, computed from the embedded coefficients: -0.02 dB at 18 kHz,
// -0.33 dB at 20 kHz, -1.86 dB at 22 kHz, -3.52 dB at 23 kHz, -6.02 dB at
// 24 kHz, -9.54 dB at 25 kHz, -14.28 dB at 26 kHz, -28.51 dB at 28 kHz.
//
// Accepted residue: the reference renderer decimates with a 127-tap
// Blackman-Harris sinc, which reads -1.06 / -18.76 / -45.10 dB at 23 / 25 /
// 26 kHz, so between 24 and 26 kHz this port folds back more than the
// reference does. It lands entirely in the 20.5-24 kHz band, and the A/B
// measures the cost: across the fourteen cases that band runs +6.72 dB at the
// worst (note 72, slave alone) and +2.81 dB at the next (note 72 with the
// master still in the mix), where it carries only 2.9% and 2.6% of the energy.
// The whole-spectrum differences remain 0.26 dB and 0.14 dB respectively.
//
// This length is also the hardware-safe point. The original 95-tap filter
// measured 585.2 instructions/sample, 113% of the calibrated CPU budget. A
// 63-tap version still measured 457.2 / 88%, whose empirical upper band crossed
// the deadline. This 47-tap version measures 393.2 / 76% (likely below the
// limit) while every committed A/B case remains within tolerance.
//
// THE MODULE'S SHAPE-CHANGE re-Init, AND WHY IT COSTS THIS ENGINE NOTHING.
// AnalogOscillator::Render calls Init() whenever the shape it has been handed
// differs from the last one it rendered (analog_oscillator.cc:74-77), and
// Init() resets pitch_ to 60 << 7 (analog_oscillator.h:77) AFTER
// RenderDualSync has already called set_pitch (macro_oscillator.cc:265, :269).
// So on the block where a shape change lands, an oscillator renders its 24
// samples at MIDI 60 rather than at the played note, and the phase error that
// leaves persists for the rest of the note. The offset is
// 24 * (f60 - fnote) / 96000 cycles -- zero at MIDI 60, larger the further
// either way from it. That is the module's own behaviour, not an artefact of
// the reference renderer, and this port does not reproduce it.
//
// For these two models it costs the A/B nothing, and that is measured rather
// than assumed. The probe is a reference build with the `pitch_ = 60 << 7`
// line deleted from Init(), i.e. the same reference with only this quirk
// removed:
//   * SAW_SYNC never triggers it. base_shape is OSC_SHAPE_SAW, which is 0, and
//     Braids' MacroOscillator is a zero-initialised file-scope object
//     (braids.cc:59), so previous_shape_ already reads OSC_SHAPE_SAW on the
//     first block: the shape never changes and Init() never fires. The
//     quirk-free build renders SAW_SYNC BIT-IDENTICAL to the stock reference,
//     at note 45 Interval 1.0 Balance 1.0 and at note 72.
//   * SQUARE_SYNC does trigger it, on BOTH oscillators, and still costs the
//     A/B nothing, because the slave is hard-synced to the master. The
//     master's block-0 error shifts the whole output in time; the slave's own
//     is erased by the next sync pulse, which puts it back on the master's
//     grid. Against the quirk-free build the stock reference at note 45
//     differs by 0.0011 dB AC RMS and 0.0022 dB spectrum -- while the two
//     waveforms are a whole signal apart sample by sample, because the shift
//     is real: it measures 16.56 samples at 48 kHz against the 16.54 the
//     formula above predicts (0.0379 cycles of 110 Hz). At note 60 the
//     master's term is zero by construction and only the slave's block-0
//     error remains: 0.0001 dB.
// So no case in tests/ab.json widens a tolerance for this. The two metrics the
// A/B reports over a steady note -- AC RMS, and an averaged magnitude spectrum
// -- are blind to a pure time shift, which is all the quirk leaves behind once
// the sync relationship is accounted for.
//
// OUT: the master/slave crossfade at Braids' balance. AUX (mono): the
// complementary crossfade, so it always favours the side OUT does not; the two
// coincide at Balance 0.5, as fold's do at its blend centre. In stereo OUT/AUX
// become L/R and take small opposing balance offsets.
//
// Declared deviations from Braids:
//   - the crossfade is applied AFTER decimation rather than at 96 kHz. Both
//     operations are linear, so this is exact for a fixed Balance and differs
//     only by the coefficient's motion across the filter's 47-sample span,
//     which is 0.49 ms at the internal rate.
//   - Braids quantises the sync pulse's position to 1/128 of a sample
//     (analog_oscillator.cc:234) before the slave reads it back; the port
//     passes the exact fractional reset time.
//   - Braids quantises the sync interval to 1/128 semitone (the >> 2 above);
//     the port sweeps it continuously, so a given TIMBRE setting can put the
//     slave up to 0.39 cents away from where the module puts it.
//   - the slave's frequency is clamped to kMaxFrequency expressed at the
//     output rate (SPEC R4), which is 11.97 kHz. Braids clamps its pitch at
//     MIDI 128 instead (analog_oscillator.cc:47-49), i.e. 13.29 kHz, so the
//     port stops the interval sweep 1.81 semitones lower. The two agree until
//     note + Interval passes MIDI 126.2.
//   - no DC blocker, matching the module: a hard-synced slave carries DC that
//     moves with the interval, and Braids emits it. Measured across the five
//     scenarios, |DC| stays under 0.028.
//   - the shape-change re-Init above: Braids renders one 24-sample block at
//     MIDI 60 the first time SQUARE_SYNC is selected, and the port does not.
//     Measured cost, from the section above: 0.0022 dB of spectrum.
//
// LEVEL (SPEC R1). Braids' own output is pinned at 0.75 of full scale by the
// int16 (Mix >> 2) * 3, and this port applies the same 0.75 -- but its peak is
// NOT pinned there, because polyBLEP overshoot and the decimator's ringing
// both sit on top of the naive waveform. The peak is a NARROW function of
// Interval, so a coarse grid understates it badly and the sweep has to be fine:
// stepping Interval at 0.005 the engine-domain peak reaches 1.015 with MACRO at
// NOON -- already past full scale on the plane Braids itself can reach (note 72,
// Balance 1.0, Interval 0.73, square) -- and 1.237 once Reset moves off noon
// (note 84, Interval 0.57, square, Reset 1.0). The package's own
// `plaits_lab check --full` shows the same thing from the other side: the `high`
// scenario, which pins MACRO at noon, renders at 0.8889 with |out_gain| 0.9
// applied, i.e. 0.988 in the engine domain. So the peak cannot be pinned
// analytically at any level worth shipping, and the gains are NEGATIVE: voice.h
// routes the render through stmlib::Limiter (voice.h:87-89) rather than straight
// into Clip16. The SDK's host renderer applies |out_gain| only, so this choice
// does not move any A/B number.
