// Braids Renaissance's four classical CHORD_* models merged into one slot,
// with WTCH exposed separately as WavetableChordEngine.
//
// Upstream is DigitalOscillator::RenderDiatonicChord in Tom Burns' Braids
// Renaissance (boourns/eurorack-renaissance): a chord built by stacking SCALE
// DEGREES on the played note rather than by looking up an interval table. The
// four classical display models -- sine, triangle, saw and square -- differ
// only in waveform, so they collapse onto MORPH the same way `triple` does.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF `chords`. Plaits' own chord engine reads a
// table of intervals in cents, and Plaits Palette lets you author that table --
// so a fixed chord shape transposed under the note is already reachable. What
// is not reachable is a chord whose QUALITY changes with the note: here the
// third is "two scale degrees up", so playing the tonic gives a major seventh
// and playing the sixth gives a minor seventh, from one knob position, with no
// table entry for either. That is the whole reason the model exists and the
// only thing that justifies the slot.
//
// WTCH is a separate engine so MORPH can scan its table while TIMBRE remains an
// independent spread control. It shares this engine's chord construction and
// ScaleVoiceBank; only the oscillator path differs.
//
// ⚠️ UPSTREAM ARITHMETIC IS NOT REPRODUCED, because it does not match its own
// labels. Renaissance's `diatonic_chords` table reads as ABSOLUTE scale degrees
// -- row 4 is {2, 6, 8} and is labelled "9th", which is degrees 6 and 8, a
// seventh and a ninth; that is right. But renderChord consumes the array
// CUMULATIVELY (`index = index + noteOffset[i-1]`), which turns that row into
// degrees 2, 8 and 16 and puts the top voice more than two octaves up. Two
// independent things say absolute is what was meant: every label in the table
// only parses as absolute, and RenderStack pre-accumulates its own offsets into
// absolute values before handing them to the same function -- which the
// cumulative read then squares into span, 3*span, 6*span, 10*span. This port
// treats the offsets as absolute. Two further upstream defects fall out with
// it: `len = diatonic_chords[ext][0] + 3` reads up to index 6 of a 4-wide row,
// and writes up to offsets[7] in a 6-element array.
//
// Anyone wanting the shipped-Renaissance voicings rather than the intended ones
// is asking for a different engine, and it should be a different engine.
