// Braids' three FM models -- FM, FBFM and WTFM -- merged into one slot.
//
// The algorithms are Emilie Gillet's RenderFm, RenderFeedbackFm and
// RenderChaoticFeedbackFm. They differ in one line each: plain FM has no
// feedback, FBFM feeds the output back into the modulator's PHASE, and WTFM
// feeds it into the modulator's FREQUENCY. MORPH puts all three on one axis.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT two-op-fm. The shipped `two-op-fm` already maps HARMONICS
// to the same ratio quantizer, TIMBRE to index and MORPH to a feedback
// topology axis, so three of four knobs overlap and Lyle should A/B before
// this ships. What genuinely differs, and what the copy has to lead on:
// unfiltered full-bandwidth feedback with no one-pole on the path; NO
// oversampling, where two-op-fm runs 4x; a LINEAR index law where two-op-fm
// squares it; WTFM's chaotic frequency feedback, which two-op-fm cannot
// reach at all; the modulator on AUX; and MACRO as feedback depth.
//
// DECLARED, because it is the point rather than an oversight: this engine
// ALIASES MORE THAN two-op-fm. Emilie's own milder engine runs 4x
// oversampling and a 0.05 one-pole on the feedback path; this runs neither,
// at 48 kHz. Both engines DO tame the index with a note-72 ramp -- two-op-fm
// squares its version, this one carries Braids' own linear one (see
// kRawFmAttenuatorSlope) -- so the taming is not part of the difference; the
// oversampling and the unfiltered feedback are. That rawness is the reason to
// keep it next to two-op-fm rather than instead of it. If it should be
// cleaned up, the fix is 4x oversampling with previous_sample updated once
// per OUTPUT sample, which preserves the one-sample loop delay exactly -- but
// that is a different engine from the one Braids has.
//
// The residual against hardware is now the missing oversampling, and it has
// TWO faces, not one. Every A/B case is inside tolerance. Most of what is left
// is a top-octave EXCESS -- fbfm-index-attenuator +2.77 dB in 10-20k and
// +18.33 dB in 20.5-24k, on 14.3% and 2.4% of the energy; fbfm-index-max
// +1.31 dB AC RMS, which is the 48 kHz loop's ~24 kHz limit cycle where the
// module's 96 kHz loop puts the same cycle at ~48 kHz and its decimator
// removes it. But fbfm-stock, the third-largest toleranced residual at
// 1.06 dB, is the other face and is NOT above 10 kHz: -0.98 dB at 1.3-2.6k on
// 13.1% of the energy, -2.30 at 2.6-5.1k on 10.3%, -4.80 at 5.1-10k on 6.2%.
// That one is DARKER than the module, because the module's loop makes
// harmonics up to 48 kHz and keeps the ones under 24 kHz through its
// decimator, where this loop never makes them at all. Do not describe the
// remaining error as top-octave aliasing alone.
//
// The WTFM modulator glide is KEPT, against the spec's instruction to remove
// it. Braids' `129 + (previous >> 9)` centre is 129/256 = 0.504, so its
// modulator does slide an octave across the top half of MORPH -- but that
// octave IS the WTFM sound. Recentring the feedback on 1.0 for continuity
// measured 43 dB away from hardware and moved the perceived fundamental a
// full octave, which would hollow out the one thing this engine has that
// two-op-fm cannot reach. The glide is named in the manual line instead,
// which was the spec's own stated alternative. The `>> 9` in that same
// expression is an arithmetic shift on a signed int16, so the feedback is a
// 128-step staircase with a downward bias rather than a continuous ramp; the
// port floors it the same way (kRawFmWtfmFeedbackSteps), which is why a WTFM
// patch's chaotic trajectory is Braids' trajectory and not a smoother
// neighbour of it.
//
// WHAT IS STILL NOT BIT-EXACT, all of it below the measurement floor of the
// A/B and none of it audible:
//   * Braids quantizes pitch_ and its ratio offset to 1/128 semitone before
//     the attenuator ramp reads them; this reads a continuous note, worth at
//     most 512/32768 * 1/128 = 0.012% of the index.
//   * `parameter_0 * attenuation >> 15` floors the attenuated index onto
//     1/32768 steps; this multiplies in float.
//   * WTFM's `modulator_phase_increment >> 8` floors the increment onto
//     multiples of 256 in a 2^32 phase accumulator. That floor is a function
//     of the module's 96 kHz increment, so it has no rate-independent form to
//     port. Its size is 128 / increment, so it GROWS as the modulator goes
//     down: a downward bias of 0.05 cents at note 45 (where every WTFM A/B
//     case sits), 0.2 cents an octave and a half below that, and ~1.2 cents
//     at the bottom of the note range with the ratio knob at -12. Inaudible
//     everywhere, but it is not one number.
