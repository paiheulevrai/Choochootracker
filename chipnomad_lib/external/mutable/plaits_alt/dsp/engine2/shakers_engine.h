// STK's Shakers -- Perry Cook's PhISEM -- as one Plaits engine.
//
// PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event Modeling) does not model an
// instrument's geometry. It models the STATISTICS of many small objects
// colliding inside a container: a shake energy that decays exponentially, a
// per-sample collision probability proportional to that energy and to the
// object count, and a handful of fixed resonances the collisions excite. Two
// dozen recognisable instruments come out of one algorithm and about eight
// numbers each, which is why sixteen of them fit in one slot.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. `particle-noise` also fires sparse events into resonators,
// but its resonances are randomly spread to make a cloud -- it is a texture
// generator. PhISEM's resonances are measured off real objects (a maraca is one
// pole at 3200 Hz; a coke can is a Helmholtz mode at 370 plus four metal modes),
// and its energy/collision statistics are what make a shaken gourd read as a
// shaken gourd rather than as filtered noise. The catalog has three analog drum
// circuits and no acoustic percussion at all; this is that.
//
// TWO MECHANISMS, not one. Most instruments are "shake": energy decays, and
// collisions inject noise into the resonators. Two are RATCHETS (guiro,
// wrench) -- a sawtooth energy ramp that resets per tooth, which is why they
// have a distinct rasping rhythm rather than a decay. One is WATER DROPS, whose
// resonators are individually retuned and swept as each drop is born. Upstream
// special-cases all three inside `tick`, and so does this.
//
// SAMPLE-RATE CORRECTION IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. Every decay constant, filter
// radius and collision probability in STK is a raw per-sample number tuned at
// 44.1 kHz. Ported unchanged to Plaits' 48 kHz they would all be ~8.8% wrong in
// the same direction: everything rings 8.8% shorter in real time and shakes
// 8.8% denser. Decays and radii are raised to the power 44100/48000, and the
// object count is scaled by the same ratio, so the instruments sound like
// themselves. The frequencies were always in Hz and need no correction.
//
// PITCH. A maraca does not have a pitch, but a Plaits user has a note input and
// expects it to do something. The note transposes every resonance of every
// instrument around MIDI 60, which is musically the right answer for the tuned
// ones (angklung is a real bamboo scale) and a size control for the rest --
// a small gourd at the top, an oil drum at the bottom.
