  // opening passes a small flow, so the lip barely swings and closure FALLS
  // (1.4% of the cycle at 0.10, against 1.9% at the 0.60 default). Buzz comes
  // from DRIVE: open the valve further, pass more flow, and the lip swings hard
  // enough to slam shut. Measured across this range, closure goes 1.5% -> 5.8%
  // and the energy above the 4th harmonic rises about 20 dB.

  // 65 Hz, near-silent). Do not widen this without re-running a HARMONICS
