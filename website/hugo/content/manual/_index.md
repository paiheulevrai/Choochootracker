# ChipNomad User Manual

**ChipNomad** is a multi-platform chiptune [tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker). It is heavily inspired by [LSDj](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php) and [Dirtywave M8](https://dirtywave.com). While ChipNomad is available for desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), it is designed for handheld consoles, such as Anbernic RG35xx, TrimUI Brick, etc.

ChipNomad currently supports only [AY-3-8910/YM2149F](/chips/ay-3-8910/). More chips coming in the future.

## Introduction

The core UI concept and the song structure is the same as in LSDj or M8 Tracker, so if you used them, then you will feel at home. LSDj-style trackers use different song structure compared to traditional trackers. In a traditional tracker the song is built as a list of patterns where each pattern has multiple tracks and a fixed number of rows. ChipNomad, like all LSDj-style trackers, uses a hierarchical structure: each song track is a list of *chains*, chains are groups of *phrases*, phrases contain notes and effects (commands). This structure works really well with small screens of handheld consoles.

ChipNomad screens are laid out in the map. Each screen is dedicated to a singe function.

## Common controls

If you're familiar with LSDj or M8, you can expect most shortcuts to work the same in ChipNomad.

ChipNomad uses 8 logical buttons. The default mapping on consoles and desktops:

| Button     | Consoles    | Desktop      |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **LEFT**   | D-Pad Left  | Cursor Left  |
| **RIGHT**  | D-Pad Right | Cursor Right |
| **UP**     | D-Pad Up    | Cursor Up    |
| **DOWN**   | D-Pad Down  | Cursor Down  |
| **EDIT**   | A           | X            |
| **OPT**    | B           | Z            |
| **PLAY**   | Start       | Space        |
| **SHIFT**  | Select      | Shift        |

You can define your own keys and have up to 3 physical buttons mapped to each logical button. You can also use gamepads.

To quit ChipNomad use the button at the Setings screen or press **MENU** + **X** on consoles.
