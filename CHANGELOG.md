## v1.0.4 (July 12, 2026)

- The all-new modulation system similar to M8 tracker. Use 4 sources to modulate different values.
  - 3 modulation types:
    - ADSR — attack-decay-sustain-release
    - AHD — attack-hold-decay
    - LFO with 10 types: Triangle, Sine, Unipolar Triangle, Unipolar Sine, Ramp Down, Ramp Up, Exp Down, Exp Up, Square, Random
- AY Plus Instrument. It uses synth-like approach to AY with using the oscillator concept.
  - Tone, Noise, and Envelope oscillators
  - Software oscillator with multiple types:
    - Pulse — software square wave with pulse width control (16/256 steps)
    - Sync Tone — hard sync'ish effect for the Tone oscillator
    - Sync Envelope — hard sync for the Envelope oscillator
    - Wavetable — 32-step wavetables (up to 256 waves per project)
    - Tone FM — simple FM for the Tone oscillator
    - Envelope FM — simple FM for the Envelope oscillator
  - All software oscillators support simple FM
- AY Sample Instrument:
  - Load 8/16/24/32 mono/stereo WAVs of any lenth. They will be converted to 8-bit mono and truncated up to 16kb.
- New phrase/table FX commands to control new instruments and the modulation system
- New Wavetable screen (under the Table screen) to edit/load/save AY wavetables
  - Copy/paste wavetables same way as Instruments: **SHIFT**+**OPT** — Copy, **SHIFT**+**EDIT** — Paste
- VSL FX command — volume slide
- Mix Volume scaling was adjusted to make 100% a usable value (values over 65% could previously cause audible distortion)
- VGM Export
